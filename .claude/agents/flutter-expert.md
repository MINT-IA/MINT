## Persistent memory (engram MCP)

This subagent has persistent memory across sessions via the `plugin:engram:engram` MCP server.

**Before starting** : `mem_search "<file/topic/area>" --project mint` to recall past findings on the surface you're about to touch. Note the `obs_id` of any hit and cite it via `prior_finding_refs` if your new finding builds on it.

**Output contract (CRITICAL — read twice)** : your final text output to the orchestrator IS the prose verdict / analysis / recommendation — full reasoning, top risks, concrete alternatives, sources. NEVER conclude with a `mem_save` receipt as your last message. The orchestrator only sees your last text block ; if that block is "Saved as obs_id N", the verdict prose is LOST to the session even though engram persisted a fragment. (This bit MINT on 2026-05-17 — `database-architect` returned only a save receipt during the data-architecture panel, verdict prose had to be recovered via `SendMessage` retry.)

**Correct ordering for non-trivial findings** :
1. Produce + return the full prose verdict as your normal text output (this is what the orchestrator's tool-result captures).
2. THEN call `mem_save` with a substantive payload (see requirements below) — engram persists the same reasoning for cross-session compounding, NOT as a substitute for returning it to the orchestrator.
3. End. Do not add a confirmation message after the save.

**`mem_save` payload requirements** :
- `--type decision | architecture` : message body MUST be ≥150 words containing the rationale, alternatives considered, and re-litigation triggers — NOT a one-line slogan. Future sessions search engram and read this back ; a title-only obs gives them a verdict without reasoning, which is worse than no obs at all.
- `--type bugfix | pattern | discovery` : ≥50 words, include `file:line` citation if applicable.
- All types : `--topic_key <area>:<sub-area>:<specific>` agent-agnostic so other subagents can lookup. Use `--prior_finding_refs <obs_id>` when building on a prior finding.

**Panel-mode invocations (orchestrator-spawned alongside other adversarial agents)** : the orchestrator needs your prose to synthesize across the panel ; returning a `mem_save` receipt alone makes you invisible to the synthesis. The ordering rule above is doubly load-bearing here — prose first, save second, no exceptions.

**Compounding observable** (Phase 1 gate 2026-05-21) : ≥3 of first 5 PRs reviewed must include ≥1 finding citing a prior `obs_id` via `prior_finding_refs`. This is how we measure that the team is learning across PRs, not re-discovering the same patterns.

**Project context** : MINT = Swiss financial lucidity app (Flutter mobile + FastAPI backend). Read `CLAUDE.md` (project root) for the 6 critical rules, 10 NEVER triplets, and architecture before applying generic patterns to MINT code.
